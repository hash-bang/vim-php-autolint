phpLint.vim
===========

This is a very simple plugin that calls "php -l" when the currently open .php file is saved.

It assumes that PHP is installed and is in your executable path.

This plugin is a direct pickup of the excellent [lint.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2578) plugin by [Joe Stelmach](https://github.com/joestelmach). I just tweaked it to call `php` instead of `jslint`.
